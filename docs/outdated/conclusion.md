3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Spawn multiple simulated players.  
   - Record final blockchain states, measure update times, confirm data consistency.

## 4. Benchmarking Approaches

1. **GPU Partitioning**:
   - Isolate rendering and cryptography tasks in separate streams.  
   - Measure frames per second (FPS) under high blockchain load.

2. **Network Latency**:
   - Introduce artificial latency or packet loss to test P2P resilience.  
   - Verify predictive ECS updates reduce perceived lag.

3. **Shard Scalability**:
   - Spin up multiple shards, each handling hundreds of transactions per second.

By leveraging Zig’s straightforward C interop, you can build a robust blockchain layer that optionally uses Vulkan Compute for cross-platform GPU acceleration. If your user base demands only NVIDIA hardware or you require advanced HPC libraries, CUDA could still outperform Vulkan for cryptographic tasks—but at the cost of portability. The final choice depends on your performance goals, hardware constraints, and desired audience reach.
