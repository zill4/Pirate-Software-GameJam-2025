   - DirectX 12 SDK: Core graphics API

3. [x] Install latest Zig compiler (0.13.0)
   - Latest stable version with best compatibility
   - Required for self-hosted compiler features
   - Includes package manager functionality

4. [X] Set up project directory structure
   ```
   mmo/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── engine/       # DirectX 12 rendering
   │   ├── network/      # MMO networking
   │   ├── physics/      # Basic collision
   │   ├── blockchain/   # Chain implementation
   │   ├── game/         # Core game logic
   │   └── tests/        # Test suites
   ├── build/
   └── build.zig
   ```
   - Logical separation of concerns
   - Makes parallel development easier
   - Clear module boundaries

5. [X] Configure build.zig
   - Set up separate build modes (debug, release, test)
   - Configure optimization levels
   - Set up test targets
   - Windows-specific optimizations

6. [X] Install DirectX 12 SDK
   - Required for 3D rendering
   - Best performance on Windows
   - Native Windows API with excellent tools
   - PIX integration for graphics debugging

7. [X] Install Windows SDK
   - Provides core Windows development tools
   - DirectX debugging utilities
   - Performance analysis tools
   - Windows-specific APIs

8. [X] Set up CI/CD pipeline (Azure DevOps)
   - Ensures build consistency
   - Runs tests automatically
   - Catches issues early
   - Native Windows build agents
