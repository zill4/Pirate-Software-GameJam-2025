# Phase 1: Development Environment & Core Infrastructure
## Environment Setup
1. [x] Install WSL2 Ubuntu environment
   - Provides Linux development environment while allowing Windows host
   - Better performance than WSL1 for GPU passthrough

2. [X] Install core build dependencies
   - build-essential: Required for compiling C dependencies
   - git: Version control
   - cmake: Required for building some dependencies
   - ninja-build: Faster build system than make
   - libssl-dev: Required for crypto functions

3. [x] Install latest Zig compiler (0.11.0)
   - Latest stable version with best compatibility
   - Required for self-hosted compiler features
   - Includes package manager functionality

4. [X] Set up project directory structure
   ```
   mmo/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── engine/       # 3D rendering
   │   ├── network/      # MMO networking
   │   ├── physics/      # Basic collision
   │   ├── blockchain/   # Chain implementation
   │   ├── game/         # Core game logic
   │   └── tests/        # Test suites
   ├── build/
   └── build.zig
   ```
   - Logical separation of concerns
   - Makes parallel development easier
   - Clear module boundaries

5. [ ] Configure build.zig
   - Set up separate build modes (debug, release, test)
   - Configure optimization levels
   - Set up test targets

6. [ ] Install Vulkan SDK
   - Required for 3D rendering
   - Better performance than OpenGL
   - More modern API with better multithreading

7. [ ] Install GLFW
   - Handles window creation and input
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Well-tested with Vulkan

8. [ ] Set up basic CI pipeline
   - Ensures build consistency
   - Runs tests automatically
   - Catches issues early

## Core Infrastructure

9. [ ] Create basic memory management system
   - Custom allocators for different subsystems
   - Arena allocator for frame-based operations
   - Pool allocator for frequently created/destroyed objects
   - Critical for performance optimization

10. [ ] Implement logging system
    - Different log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
    - File and console output
    - Performance tracking capabilities
    - Critical for debugging and monitoring

11. [ ] Create error handling framework
    - Define error types and handling strategies
    - Set up error propagation patterns
    - Establish recovery mechanisms
    - Essential for robust operation

12. [ ] Set up configuration system
    - Load settings from files
    - Runtime configuration changes
    - Default fallbacks
    - Enables easy testing and deployment

13. [ ] Create basic test framework
    - Unit test infrastructure
    - Integration test framework
    - Performance test utilities
    - Critical for maintaining quality

14. [ ] Implement basic profiling tools
    - Memory usage tracking
    - CPU performance monitoring
    - I/O operation tracking
    - Essential for optimization

## Initial Testing & Verification

15. [ ] Create environment verification tests
    - Verify all dependencies are available
    - Check build system functionality
    - Validate development tools
    - Ensures consistent development environment

16. [ ] Set up performance benchmarks
    - Memory allocation/deallocation
    - Basic operations timing
    - I/O performance
    - Establishes baseline for optimization

17. [ ] Document setup process
    - Installation instructions
    - Configuration guidelines
    - Common issues and solutions
    - Enables team onboarding
