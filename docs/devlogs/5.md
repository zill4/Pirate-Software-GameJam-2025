## Day 5 | 1/23/25


Going to end this project.
I like the idea of learning to make an engine in zig, but its not that useful.
Working with Unreal Engine 5 for an ambitious project that could actually add value sounds more fun.
People will think its cringe, but that's fine. I think this has real potential now putting the pieces together.

Will need to come up with a good name for the whole thing.
Its going to be great.
