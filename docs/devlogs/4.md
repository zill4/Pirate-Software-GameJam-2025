## Day 4 | 1/22/25


Okay we are restarting, taking a step back again.
Why? Because as I was developing the main engine I didn't consider the complexity of baking in a blockchain to the core of it.

So I went back and asked O1 and Claude some questiosn to clarify the development, and we should have more robust and realistic plan in place for development.
