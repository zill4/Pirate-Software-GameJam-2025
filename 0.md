This repository will serve as both the source for my submission to the PirateSoftware GameJam,
but also as a living journal of the development process, i.e. DevLog.

As of the moment of writing I am not ready to begin coding, but will list a few ideas I had for development.

Theme: `You are the weapon.`

1. Stream game, Streamer is Commander, chat is controls units. Streamer view is a top down RTS like Warcraft 3. Viewer view is 3rd/1st person in the world. Thinking Minecraft meets Warcraft 3.

2. ?

It is very tempting to write my own game-engine as a 'marketing' and learning experience, but I will need to weigh the pro/cons, the other most obvious choice is Unreal Engine 5.

I think Unreal Engine 5 would be the best option. Their are a few reasons, but primarily knowing Uneal Engine 5 is a useful and transferable skill compared to being decent at Rust/C/Assembly/Go etc., and it is objectively considered the industry standard for many reasons. Though, X users may 'bait' individuals into the idea that creating your own game engine is better, it is less useful as a skill as a whole, and an excercise in hubiris.

It would be best most likely to just use the assets I currently own and focus on innovating on the combat, level destructability, and building. Having the game-play as close to Minecraft as possible would be ideal. 

TODO:
  1. Create action plan including schedule.
  2. Convert to Git LFS version control for the project.
  3. Research existing games or examples, build up context library for llm.
  4. Look into LLM assitance for Unreal 5 docs.
