# Day 2 | 1/20/25

Currently recording, ate my veggies today, lets start coding.

TODO:
    
    1. We need to create a plan of attack for building the game engine. 
    We should likely create a meta-request for prompting the AI into creating its own design doc for building an engine in zig.
    2. Start implementing from the design design/plan of attack doc.
    3. Ideally we will get to a stop point by EOD where we can start implementing game-logic.
    4. It would be best to keep the engine and game logic seperate such that we could build more games in the future on top of the engine.

    Z3R0-ENGINE sounds kinda cool...
